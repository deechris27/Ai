Abstract: This study aims to determine the effects of destination personality,
self-congruence, and functional fit on revisit intention. At the same time, the
importance performance matrix analysis (IPMA) is used to determine the level
of participation of individuals in leisure and recreational activities. The
research population consists of tourists visiting the city of Bolu Mudurnu in
Turkey, and 406 questionnaires were analysed. The convenience sampling
method was used in the research. Structural equation model was used to
analyse the data. In this context, it was found that destination personality of the
tourists participating in the research has a positive effect on self-congruence,
functional fit and revisit intention, that self-congruence has a positive effect on
functional fit and revisit intention. That functional fit has a positive effect on
revisit intention.

1 Introduction
Tourism brings about numerous economic, social, and cultural benefits to various
destinations worldwide. To attract tourists, destinations adopt different strategies, and one
highly effective approach is to establish a unique and distinct destination personality.
This distinct personality helps in capturing tourists’ interest and sets the place apart from
others (Ekinci and Hosany, 2006; Murphy et al., 2007a). Understanding the personality
traits of a destination becomes crucial as it helps in meeting tourists’ expectations and
significantly increases their intention to return. Before embarking on a journey to a new
destination, tourists take into account various factors, such as local infrastructure,
attractions, historical significance, and the overall appeal of the place (Hsu et al., 2009).
However, purely functional aspects might not entirely explain tourists’ inclination to
revisit a destination. The concept of self-congruence becomes essential as it enables
tourists to form a strong emotional connection with the destination, ultimately influencing
their intention to revisit (Murphy et al., 2007b; Souiden et al., 2017). Hence, both
destination personality and self-congruence play pivotal roles in shaping tourists’
intentions to revisit a place (Sirgy and Su, 2000). Nevertheless, there is still a lack of
adequate research on the combined effects of self-congruence and functional fit on
tourists’ revisit intentions.
This study aims to bridge this research gap by examining the destination personality
of the Mudurnu district in Bolu and how self-congruence and functional fit influence
tourists’ intention to revisit this region. The objectives include identifying the destination
personality of Mudurnu, assessing tourists’ levels of self-congruence and functional fit,
and analysing the impact of these factors on their intention to revisit. While some studies
have explored the relationship between destination personality and self-congruence in
tourists’ revisit intentions, such as Wang et al.’s (2018) research in Guilin, China, few
have focused on the effects of both self-congruence and functional fit. However, Kumar
and Nayak (2014a) investigated the effect of functional fit on tourists’ revisit intentions
and found a positive correlation.
The findings of this study will contribute valuable insights to the existing literature by
exploring the influence of destination personality, self-congruence, and functional fit on
tourists’ revisit intentions, specifically in the Mudurnu district. These insights will be
beneficial for destination managers, empowering them to devise effective strategies to
82 E. Baydeniz and M. Valeri
increase tourists’ visits and revisit intentions. By identifying the distinctive personality
traits of Mudurnu and understanding tourists’ self-congruence and functional fit,
destination managers can tailor their offerings and enhance the overall visitor experience,
thereby attracting more tourists to the region.
Moreover, this research addresses a significant gap in the literature by focusing on the
Mudurnu district of Bolu. Although numerous studies have investigated destination
personality, self-congruence, and functional fit in different locations, there is limited
research on these factors in the context of Mudurnu. Understanding the unique
destination personality of Mudurnu and its impact on tourists’ self-congruence and
functional fit can offer valuable insights into the specific characteristics and attributes
that attract visitors to this region.
By examining tourists’ intention to revisit Mudurnu, this study contributes to the
understanding of destination loyalty and the factors influencing tourists’ decision-making
processes. Revisit intention serves as an indicator of a destination’s success, reflecting
tourists’ satisfaction and desire to return. Therefore, exploring the effects of destination
personality, self-congruence, and functional fit on revisit intention can assist destination
managers in developing effective marketing strategies and improving the tourism
experience in Mudurnu. Recreational activities encompass a wide range of pursuits,
including sports, outdoor adventures, cultural outings, creative hobbies, and social
interactions (Franceschinis et al., 2022). Engaging in these activities not only brings joy
and fulfilment but also contributes to physical well-being, mental rejuvenation, and the
development of new skills and interests. Furthermore, recreational activities often foster a
sense of community, connection, and shared experiences, making them valuable
components of a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle (Alessandro, 2022).
The results of this study will provide destination managers with practical insights and
actionable recommendations. By understanding the unique personality traits of Mudurnu,
destination managers can emphasise and promote these traits in their marketing efforts to
attract a specific target market that resonates with the destination’s personality.
Moreover, by recognising the importance of self-congruence and functional fit, managers
can tailor their offerings and experiences to the preferences and expectations of their
target audience, thereby increasing visitor satisfaction and the likelihood of Mudurnu
return visits.
2 Conceptual framework
2.1 Destination personality
Destination personality is a fascinating concept that emerges from the combination of
unique characteristics found in various tourist destinations. In this context, personality
refers to the distinctive characteristics and emotional qualities associated with a person
(TDK, 2022). Similarly, destination personality encompasses a set of human-like
characteristics attributed to tourism destinations (Hosany et al., 2006). This concept plays
an important role in how tourists perceive and connect with travel destinations.
Destination personality emerges when we apply brand personality traits, commonly
found in marketing literature, to tourist destinations such as cities or regions (Aaker,
1997). It blends the functional, symbolic, and experiential aspects of a place (Hankinson,
2004), all of which contribute to shaping the destination’s image and how it is perceived
Recreational activity and intention revisit 83
by tourists (Opoku, 2009). Understanding destination personality can significantly impact
how tourists experience and relate to the places they visit. Creating a destination
personality is necessary to brand a tourist destination (Kumar and Nayak, 2014b).
Destination personality can increase the competitiveness of destinations in the market by
enabling tourists to perceive, talk about, and share destinations (Balakrishnan and
Jayapalan, 2007). There are two main factors to consider when creating a destination
personality. The first factor is determining the destination’s functional, symbolic, and
experiential characteristics. The second factor is the orientation effect that can occur
toward tourists’ perceptions and desires (Kaushal et al., 2019). Since destination
personality allows tourists to perceive and personalise destinations, it should have strong
personality characteristics and an orientation effect toward tourists’ perceptions and
desires (Gomez Aguilar et al., 2014).
2.2 Self-congruence
Self-congruence is defined as an individual’s self-existence, personality, individuality,
and the elements that make up the self (Baumeister, 2018; Markus and Nurius, 1986;
Swann et al., 2015). Self-congruence is formed due to the combination of the individual’s
feelings, perceptions, attitudes, and views about the self and the evaluations of others
(Kang and Sung, 2021). Self-congruence has four dimensions: actual self, ideal self,
social self, and ideal social self (Lin and Chao, 2022; Markus and Nurius, 1986).
Accurate self-congruence refers to the harmony between one’s self-perception and one’s
image of oneself (Lin and Chao, 2022). Ideal self-perception, on the other hand, reflects
how one would like to see oneself and the self-perception one desires (Baumeister, 2018;
Markus and Nurius, 1986). Social self-perception relates to how others perceive one
(Swann et al., 2015). Ideal social self-perception is related to how one would like to be
perceived by others (Lin and Chao, 2022; Markus and Nurius, 1986).
Regarding consumer behaviour, self-congruence can be explained by the preference
for products with a similar image to one’s own (Lin and Chao, 2022; Sirgy, 1982).
Therefore, the level of self-representation and the congruence of the product with the
consumer’s self-perception play an essential role in deciding whether to purchase a
product (Lin and Chao, 2022; Sirgy, 1982). Most research on self-congruence shows that
individuals’ ideal self-perceptions guide their self-perceptions and that the products they
often prefer to fit their ideal selves (Lin and Chao, 2022; Markus and Nurius, 1986).
When consumers purchase a product, the conformity of the product with social
expectations is as necessary as the conformity of the product with their self-perceptions
(Sirgy, 1982; Swann et al., 2015). As a result, self-congruence plays a vital role in
consumer behaviour. Consumers’ decision to purchase a product is influenced by the
unity of the product with their self-perceptions and social expectations. Therefore, sales
and marketing strategies should follow consumers’ self-perceptions (Sirgy, 1982; Swann
et al., 2015).
2.3 Functional fit
Functional fit is the difference between consumers’ attitudes, thoughts, and perceptions
about the functions related to the performance they receive from the product or service
they purchase and the features they encounter (Johar and Sirgy, 1991). Consumers make
84 E. Baydeniz and M. Valeri
cost-benefit assessments in the purchase decision process and prefer products that
provide benefits commensurate with their costs (Kumar and Nayak, 2014b). Functional
fit states that consumers consider the benefits they will receive from a product when
purchasing it (Samli and Sirgy, 1982). Chon and Olsen (1991) noted that functional fit
directly affects tourists’ post-visit behaviour. Sirgy and Su (2000) contributed to the field
by demonstrating the role of functional adjustment in predicting tourist behaviour from a
theoretical perspective.
Functional fit can measure the differences between consumers’ product expectations
and perceived performance (Klipfel et al., 2014). Therefore, functional fit is of great
importance in understanding consumers. Since functional fit is based on the theory of
self-fit, it was introduced to determine consumer behaviour in tourism (Kim et al., 2004).
While functional fit is mainly a brand positioning tool in marketing, it has been
characterised as consumer perception, brand image and extended functionality in tourism
(Chon, 1990; Klipfel et al., 2014). Functional fit in tourism can be defined as the
difference between the benefits tourists expect from a destination and the performance
they perceive (Chon and Olsen, 1991). Therefore, tourism organisations can use the
concept of functional fit to understand tourists’ expectations and needs.
2.4 Revisit intention
Intention to revisit refers to the desire and willingness of tourists to return to a specific
destination, brand, or product (Xiang et al., 2017). This aspect is of utmost importance in
the tourism industry, as it directly impacts the success of businesses (Bigne et al., 2020).
The decision of whether tourists intend to revisit a place is influenced by various factors,
such as their past experiences, level of satisfaction, and perceived value (Li and Petrick,
2016). Additionally, tourists’ inclination towards novelty and the competitive appeal of
alternative destinations also play a role in shaping their intention to revisit (Gursoy et al.,
2020).
The intention to revisit is considered a vital indicator of success for tourism
senterprises by many researchers (Bigne et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2017). Consequently, it
becomes imperative for companies to develop effective strategies that can enhance
tourists’ satisfaction levels, elevate the perceived value of their offerings, and ultimately
encourage them to revisit.
Tourists’ intention to revisit a destination increases when their previous experiences
are positive (Li and Petrick, 2016). In addition, tourists’ perceived value and satisfaction
are among the critical factors influencing their revisit intention (Bigne et al., 2020). On
the other hand, tourists’ innovation-seeking tendencies and competition among
alternative destinations are other factors affecting revisit intentions (Gursoy et al., 2020).
Therefore, businesses need to offer services in line with tourists’ innovation-seeking
tendencies and highlight the unique features of their destinations.
3 Method
3.1 Study site: Bolu Mudurnu
The place where the research was conducted is Bolu Mudurnu. Bolu Mudurnu is a district
located in the Black Sea region of Turkey and is an important tourist destination. In this
Recreational activity and intention revisit 85
study, 406 participants were selected from tourists visiting Bolu Mudurnu using a
non-probability convenience sampling method. The survey form used in the research was
applied by face-to-face interview method in touristic destination in Bolu Mudurnu.
3.2 Research instrument
The measurement tool used in this study is a questionnaire form prepared to measure
destination personality, self-congruence, functional fit and revisit intention. The questions
in the questionnaire were inspired by the scales used in the literature. The questionnaire
has two parts. The first part contains questions about the demographic characteristics of
the participants. The second part contains items related to destination personality,
self-congruence, functional fit and intention to revisit.
The eight-item scale developed by Bosnjak et al. (2011) was used as the
self-congruence scale. As the destination personality scale, the eight-item, one-dimension
scale developed by Aaker (1997), Murphy et al. (2007a), and Yeh et al. (2010) were used.
A three-item scale developed by Lee and Chang (2012) was used for the revisit intention
variable. The questionnaire form was administered to tourists at the tourist sites of Bolu
Göynük using the face-to-face interview method. The answers to the questions in the
questionnaire were coded in the SPSS statistical programme and made suitable for
analysis.
3.3 Sampling and data collection
In this study, the non-probability convenience sampling method was preferred. The
research was conducted with 396 participants randomly selected among the tourists in the
tourist places of Bolu Göynük. The data were collected through the face-to-face interview
method. The researchers distributed the questionnaire form to the participants in the
tourist places and filled it by the participants. The questionnaire form was coded
according to the participants’ answers and made suitable for analysis. The sample size
was calculated using G*POWER 3.1.9.4 software (Faul et al., 2007). It was determined
that the required sample size was 98 (power = 0.80, f
2 = 0.15, α = 0.05). However, to
obtain a more consistent model, this number was multiplied by three (Ringle et al., 2015),
and a sample of at least 300 was deemed appropriate. Finally, it was decided to collect
396 questionnaires to compensate for similar unforeseen uncertainties. The data obtained
in the research were analysed using SPSS statistical software. The data were first
processed for measurement model analyses and then evaluated in a three-stage approach
as a structural model and path analysis. Measurement model analyses were conducted to
examine the validity and reliability results of the scales and to evaluate the effectiveness
of the structural model.
3.4 Data analysis
In this study, data were first processed for measurement model analyses and then
evaluated using a three-stage approach as the structural model and path analysis.
Measurement model analyses were conducted to provide information on the validity and
reliability of the scales. These analyses used statistical methods such as internal
consistency coefficient (Cronbach’s alpha), convergent validity between scales, average
86 E. Baydeniz and M. Valeri
variance extracted, and factor loadings of each scale. Structural model and path analysis
were used to test the research hypotheses. In these analyses, statistical methods, including
model fit values, model effect size and structural equation model results were used.
Cross-loading and discriminant validity analyses were also conducted. Cross-loading
analyses were conducted to verify that each scale was highly correlated only with its
factor. Discriminant validity analyses were conducted to verify that each scale was highly
correlated only with its factor and lowly correlated with other factors.

Confirmatory tetrad analyses (CTA) were performed on the scales included in the model
(Gudergan et al., 2008), and it was found that all variables had a value of ‘0’ in the
confidence intervals and showed the reflective property (Hair et al., 2017). In this
context, covariance-based structural equation modeling was carried out. For this purpose,
the PLSc (consistent PLS) tab in the SmartPLS software was used.
In the literature (Schaarschmidt et al., 2015), there is the idea that questionnaires used
from a single source potentially pose a bias threat in social science research. Therefore,
we investigated whether common method bias threatens the interpretation of research
findings. All items were subjected to principal components factor analysis, and Harman’s
one-factor test was applied (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). It was found that all items
entered did not explain the 50% variance threshold with a single factor (36.250%), and
there was no common method bias in the research.

4 Findings
52.1% of the participants are female, and 47.9% are male, and when analysing the marital
status, 60% are married, and 40% are single. When analysing the age groups of the
participants, the highest participation is in the 36–45 age groups, with 32.8%, followed
by the 26–35 age groups, with 24.1%. Looking at the educational level of the
participants, 52.1% of the participants have a bachelor’s degree, and 1.5% has a
doctorate. When analysing the income status of the participants, 39.6% of them have an
income of 9,001–12,000, while 2.7% have an income of 15001 and above.
In order to identify the constructs with variance outlier factor (outer VIF) values
equal to or higher than 5, the collinearity test proposed by Kock and Lynn (2012) was
performed (Hair et al., 2017). According to the relevant results, it was determined that
there were no collinearity problems in the Outer VIF value of all constructs, and the
values were less than 5 (Hair et al., 2017).
Cronbach alpha (α) and rho_A values were analysed for the scale’s reliability.
According to Dijkstra and Henseler (2015), α and rho_A values greater than 0.70 indicate
good reliability. This study concluded that the α values of the scales were between
0.924–0.975 and had good reliability. In addition, the rho_A reliability coefficient was in
the range of 0.944–0.976 and gave better results than the α values. AVE values were
analysed for the convergent validity of the scale, and integrated reliability (rho_C) values
were examined for internal consistency. AVE values ranged from 0.635–0.830, and
according to Fornell and Larcker (1981), AVE should be > 0.50 and above; rho_C values
ranged from 0.924–0.975 and according to Bagozzi and Yi (1988), rho_C should be >
0.60 and above (see Table 2).
In order to determine the discriminant validity of the scales, the Fornell-Larcker
criterion was calculated. When the correlation loadings between the variables were
examined, it was found that all variables were lower than the √AVE value, thus providing
the first level of discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) (see Table 3).

When examining the HTMT discriminant validity analysis of the scales, it was stated that
each value should be less than 0.80 (Voorhees et al., 2016). When examining the results
of the related analysis, it was determined that the average of the correlation values of the
Recreational activity and intention revisit 89
variables was less than 0.80, and the second level of discriminant validity was provided
(see Table 4).

The research examined the cross-loading values and measurement items of each
construct. The correlation loadings between the items of each scale are expected to be
higher than those of other items (Hair et al., 2017). It is argued that the cross-loading
value of the relevant items should be greater than 0.7 (Ghozali and Latan, 2015). It was
determined that the cross-loading values of the study were more significant than 0.7, and
the final stage of discriminant validity was achieved (see Table 4).
Before testing the research model, the model’s goodness of fit (GoF) was tested. The
standard root mean square root (SRMR) is the difference between the observed and
predicted correlations, and the relevant value should be less than 0.08 (Hu and Bentler,
1998). The other fit index is the normed fit index (NFI), an incremental fit measure
calculated and compared with the X2 value of the proposed model. NFI values above 0.9
represent an acceptable fit (Lohmöller, 1989). Dijkstra and Henseler (2015) suggest that
d_ULS and d_G should be considered as two different ways of calculating this
discrepancy. Suppose the difference between the correlation matrix implied by the tested
model and the empirical correlation matrix is so small that it can only be attributed to
sampling error. In that case, it is a good model (p > 0.05). Henseler et al. (2016) state that
d_ULS and d_G should be lower than < 95% bootstrapped quantile values. The GoF
value results from the square root of the product of the AVE mean and the R2 mean and is
used to determine the general predictive power of the research model (Tenenhaus et al.,
2005). When examining the GoF values of the model, it can be said that all values
provide a good fit (see Table 5).
4.1 Structural model analysis
Linearity path coefficients (R2) and the research model’s effect size values (f
2) were
calculated. When the variance inflation factor (VIF) values were examined during the
structural equation modelling process of the research model, it was understood that the
relevant values were less than five, and there was no linearity problem (Hair et al., 2017).
The effect size coefficients (f
2) are between 0.126 and 1.353. When analysing the R2
values obtained from the model, it was found that self-congruence was explained by
1.5%, functional fit by 4.3%, and revisit intention by 6.6% (see Table 6).
Mean absolute error (MAE) (PLS-predict) was analysed to examine the mean
magnitude of error associated with the endogenous variables’ results and identify
differences between them. Comparing the PLS-MAE and LV-MAE values of the
90 E. Baydeniz and M. Valeri
dependent variables revisit intention scales, it was found that the LV-MAE values had a
higher ratio than the PLS-MAE values. Furthermore, on the other hand, it was determined

determined that the model’s predictive power was high (Hair et al., 2017).

According to the path analysis results, destination personality has a significant positive
effect on self-congruence (β = 0.392, p > 0.05), functional fit (β = 0.487, p > 0.05), and
revisit intention (β = 0.260, p > 0.05). Hypotheses H1, H2, and H3 are therefore accepted.
Self-congruence has a significant positive effect on functional fit (β = 0.290,
p > 0.05) and revisits intention (β = 0.279, p > 0.05). Hypotheses H4 and H5 are therefore
accepted. Functional fit has a significant positive effect on revisit intention
(β = 0.445, p > 0.05). Therefore, Hypothesis H6 is accepted (see Table 7). The results of
the research model are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 3 IPMA result (see online version for colours)
Figure 3 demonstrates that functional fit, self-congruence, and destination personality
play a crucial role in determining tourists’ intention to revisit a destination, showcasing
their significant impact on performance. These factors serve as essential determinants in
influencing individuals’ engagement in leisure and recreational activities. Notably,
self-congruence emerges as the most influential factor, surpassing others in terms of
performance importance for revisit intention. This emphasises the critical role of
destination personality, functional fit factors, and self-fitness in shaping tourists’
intention to revisit. Consequently, the tourism industry should prioritise these factors to
enhance customer satisfaction and promote repeat visits.

5 Conclusions and implications
The present study focused on examining the impact of tourists’ perceptions of a
destination’s personality on self-congruence, functional fit, and revisit intention in
Mudurnu. In addition, the study examined the relationships between self-congruence and
functional fit, as well as functional fit and revisit intention. The results of the hypothesis
tests indicated that destination personality perceptions significantly and positively
influence self-congruence, functional fit, and revisit intention. As a result, Hypotheses
H1, H2 and H3 were confirmed.
These findings are consistent with previous research conducted by Huang et al.
(2017), who also found a positive relationship between destination personality perception
and self-congruence. Similarly, Baloglu et al. (2014) showed that destination personality
perceptions of cruise tourists visiting Jamaica had a positive effect on their revisit
intentions. In another study, Hultman et al. (2017) reported that perceptions of destination
personality had a positive impact on functional fit. Furthermore, Murphy et al. (2007b)
observed a moderate correlation between destination personality perceptions and tourists’
likelihood to revisit Australia.
On the other hand, Usakli and Baloglu (2011) found that destination personality
perceptions influenced both self-congruence and revisit intentions. The study also found
that self-congruence significantly and positively influenced functional fit and revisit
intention. In addition, functional fit was found to have a significant positive effect on
revisit intention. As a result, Hypotheses H4, H5, and H6 were supported.
The results of this study are consistent with research conducted by Hung and Petrick
(2011), where functional fit and self-congruence were found to have a positive effect on
the intention to participate in cruise tourism. Similarly, in another study conducted by
Hung and Petrick (2012), self-congruence and functional fit were found to have positive
effects on revisit intention. Therefore, the findings of this study are supported by other
studies in the extant literature.
5.1 Theoretical implications
The research findings have significant theoretical implications, serving as a valuable
reference for understanding and effectively managing customer behaviour in the tourism
sector. The study explores the key factors influencing tourists’ choice of destination and
confirms the interconnectedness of destination personality perception; self-congruence,
functional fit, and revisit intention. Destination personality perception emerges as a
crucial element impacting tourists’ destination choices. To optimise their marketing
strategies, destinations should highlight and promote desirable personality traits. By
doing so, they can positively influence tourists’ perceptions and attitudes towards the
destination, ultimately shaping their preferences.
Tourists’ self-congruence also plays a vital role in determining their chosen
destination. When there is a harmonious match between tourists’ characteristics and
preferences with those of the destination, it enhances the overall appeal of the place.
Therefore, destinations should aim to customise tourism experiences to better align with
tourists’ expectations, ultimately increasing their sense of self-congruence. Additionally,
functional fit holds significant importance in influencing tourists’ decision-making
process. Destinations need to cater to tourists’ specific needs by offering appropriate
94 E. Baydeniz and M. Valeri
products and services. This level of personalisation contributes to greater tourist
satisfaction and increases the likelihood of return visits.
The intention to revisit a destination is a pivotal indicator in the tourism sector. A
positive and memorable tourism experience can significantly impact tourists’ intention to
return. Therefore, destinations should strive to create unique and memorable experiences
for visitors, encouraging them to come back in the future. Overall, understanding and
influencing tourist behaviour is critical for the growth and sustainability of the tourism
industry. By consistently providing innovative products and services tailored to meet
tourists’ needs, the sector can foster positive behaviour among tourists and stimulate
industry growth. Prioritising these aspects is vital for ensuring the continued success of
the tourism sector.
5.2 Practical implications
To improve tourist satisfaction and encourage their return, destinations must carefully
consider the practical implications of their actions. Understanding the personality traits
that tourists perceive and incorporating these traits into marketing strategies can
significantly enhance the destination’s appeal. By adapting to tourists’ characteristics and
providing experiences that resonate with them, destinations can create more positive and
memorable tourism experiences, increasing the likelihood of repeat visits.
To further increase tourist satisfaction and intention to return, destinations should
focus on offering products and services that meet tourists’ specific needs. This functional
fit ensures that visitor’ expectations are met, leading to higher levels of satisfaction and a
greater likelihood of future visits. By prioritising positive experiences and constantly
innovating to meet tourists’ evolving preferences, the tourism sector can influence and
stimulate its own growth.
Continuous innovation is critical to the sustainability and growth of the tourism
industry. Destinations should always strive to develop new and unique products and
services that meet the demands of tourists. By doing so, they can not only meet the
immediate needs of visitors, but also create a dynamic and appealing environment that
will attract more tourists over time.
Ultimately, destinations that take into account the practical implications outlined in
this research can increase tourist satisfaction, increase the likelihood of repeat visits, and
make a significant contribution to the overall growth of the tourism sector. These
considerations are critical to guiding the tourism industry toward a sustainable and
prosperous future.
5.3 Limitations and recommendations for future research
The study has certain limitations that need to be acknowledged in order to better
understand its findings. First, the sample size was relatively small, which may affect the
overall reliability and applicability of the results. In addition, the data collection was
based on a questionnaire, which could potentially introduce biases or limitations in
capturing the full complexity of tourist behaviour. Another factor to consider is that the
study focused only on tourists travelling to Turkey. Therefore, it may not be
representative of tourist behaviour in other regions or countries. To address this, future
research should aim to include a more diverse range of destinations and tourist
populations to ensure broader generalisability. In order to gain a more comprehensive
Recreational activity and intention revisit 95
understanding of tourist behaviour, it would be beneficial to include a wider range of
factors in future studies. This could include examining different aspects and
characteristics of different tourist segments. In this way, destinations can develop
targeted marketing strategies tailored to the specific preferences and needs of different
types of tourists. It is also important to assess whether tourist behaviour is in line with the
goals of sustainable tourism. Conducting research in this area will help promote
sustainable practices within the tourism sector and contribute to its long-term viability. In
future studies, researchers should explore additional factors that influence tourist
behaviour, such as the impact of their previous tourism experiences, price considerations,
weather patterns, travel purposes, and the unique characteristics of different destinations.
In particular, tourism experience plays an important role in shaping tourist behaviour.
Therefore, devoting more research efforts to investigate this aspect will provide valuable
insights for industry stakeholders and policy makers.
